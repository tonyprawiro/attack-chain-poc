# Proof of Concept: LLM-Assisted Cyber Attack Chain

Potential Use Cases:

- Support in assigning vulnerability remediation prioritization scores.
- Aid penetration testers in gray-box or white-box testing scenarios.

The `prompt.txt` file includes a sample prompt that users can provide to the LLM. It is used in conjunction with JSON files supplied to the model for analysis.
