Analyze the attached JSON files:

- information-systems.json: Lists applications in the network environment and their associated hosts. For each host, details include the operating system (OS) and installed software.
- connectivity.json: Describes available connectivity between hosts.
- vulnerabilities.json: Contains a list of vulnerabilities of interest, including web application weaknesses and known vulnerabilities from the publicly available CVE database.
- scan-data.json: Lists vulnerabilities discovered on each host during a scan.

Task:

Construct a hypothetical attack chain that a malicious actor might execute. The attack chain consists of nodes, where each node includes:

- A host being exploited (fields: host_name, host_ip_address)
- A single vulnerability being exploited (fields: vulnerability_id, vulnerability_name)

Starting Point:

Assume the attacker successfully exploits vulnerability "CVE-2024-6387" on host4 as the entry point.

Guidelines:

- After exploiting a vulnerability, the attacker will move laterally to other hosts if connectivity exists between the current host and the target host (based on connectivity.json), and the target host has a vulnerability listed in scan-data.json.
- Prioritize lateral movement to a host within an application with the same or higher criticality rating than the current host. Criticality ratings are found in information-systems.json.
- Limit the attack chain to 5 nodes.
- Stop the chain if any node other than the first has a criticality rating of high. No further lateral movement should be attempted in this case.

Output Format:

Provide the attack chain in JSON format, including the following fields for each node:

- vulnerability_id
- vulnerability_name
- host_name
- host_ip_address

Additional Notes:

- Iterate through the provided data to determine the sequence of exploits and lateral movements.
- Think like a malicious actor aiming to maximize impact and leverage available vulnerabilities.
